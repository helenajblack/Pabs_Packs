# Pab's Packs App
---
An easy-to-use full-stack application that allows users at Pab's Packs to easily track manage their inventory and creates a database for their events.

## What is Pab's Packs?
---
Pab's Packs is a non-profit organization created by two teenagers (Abbie and Pia) after they were hospitalized in their youth. The organization's mission is to provide backpacks for hospitalized youth and provide them with things to raise their spirits during their stay in the hospital - warm blankets, lotion, stress balls, a journal, lotions, lip balm, and a stuffed penguin named "Pabby". The organization runs packing events where volunteers can come pack the packs, and then those packs are delivered to the hospitalized children. They support themselves through the selling of merchandise.

## What problem are we trying to solve?
---
Pab's Packs approached us with a need to convert their inventory and event tracking system from hard to read, excessive, and inefficient excel spreadsheets into an easy-to-use website to track inventory and keep track of upcoming and past events.
